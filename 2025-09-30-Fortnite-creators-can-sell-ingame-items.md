🎮 Fortnite Creators Can Sell In-Game Items Starting December 2025
Big news for Fortnite creators: starting December 2025, you’ll be able to sell in-game items directly from the islands you build! Epic Games is rolling out tools to make this happen, giving creators more control and more ways to earn.

🚀 Fortnite Is More Than Just Battle Royale
Epic Games is on a mission to evolve Fortnite into a full-blown creative universe. With user-generated content (UGC) becoming a core part of the game, Fortnite is shifting from a battle royale experience to a platform where creators can build, monetize, and thrive.

💰 100% V-Bucks Revenue for Creators in 2025
Here’s the juicy part: throughout 2025, creators will earn 100% of their V-Bucks value from item sales. That’s a massive win compared to other platforms. In 2026, this will drop to 50%, but even then, it’s still competitive with Roblox’s revenue share.

📊 How V-Bucks Value Is Calculated
Epic Games explains the math like this:

“To determine the V-Bucks value in USD, we take all customer real-money spending to purchase V-Bucks (converted to USD), subtract platform and store fees (ranging from 12% on Epic Games Store to 30% on consoles), and divide it by the total V-Bucks spent by players.”

Average platform/store fees: 26%

100% V-Bucks value ≈ 74% of retail spending

50% V-Bucks value ≈ 37% of retail spending

🛠️ New Tools: Verse API + UEFN
Creators will use a Verse-based API and new Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN) tools to add purchasable items to their islands. These include:

Durable items (like gear or skins)

Consumables (like boosts or power-ups)

🧾 Epic’s Cut Explained
Epic will take a cut from:

The Sponsored Row (already live)

User-created item sales

Why? Because they’ve been operating at a loss and need to balance the books while still supporting creators.
